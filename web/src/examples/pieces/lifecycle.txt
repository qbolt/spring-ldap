The `render` method of a component is a pure function. It needs to be stateless.
There can't be any ajax requests, state manipulation, redux actions, or any other side-effects.

Those things can't happen in the render method, but they are still critical parts of our application that need
to happen. The place that they happen is in component lifecycle methods.

Lifecycle methods are special methods each component CAN have that allow us to hook into
the views when specific conditions happen. (when the component first renders or when the component gets updated with new data, etc)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can break React's Life Cycle Methods down into two categories.

1) When a component gets mounted to the DOM and unmounted.
2) When a component receives new data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some things we may need to do when a component is mounted or unmounted
  - Establish some default props in our component
  - Set some initial state in our component
  - Make an Ajax request to fetch some data needed for this component
  - Set up any listeners (ie Websockets or Firebase listeners)
  - Remove any listeners you initially set up (when unmounted)
